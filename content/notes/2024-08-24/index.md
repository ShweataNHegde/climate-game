## Key Points
- **What’s the goal?** People to engage with climate change more openly → make people more receptive to scientific information and increase intellectual humility → address information avoidance → decrease climate fatigue and despair → climate science and advocacy more proximal to people. Do we want the players to become? Climate activists? Informed citizens?
- **How to ensure that we don’t fall back to the “doomsday” narrative?** Disengagement with the world we are currently in - distinct future/parallel universe. It is your world but fantastical element - situate our situation in another fantasy world that is similar enough but different. Make it fun, have in-jokes!
- **How to tackle climate deniers?** Example of a [nobel prize physicist](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2023/11/16/he-won-nobel-prize-then-he-started-denying-climate-change/) denying climate change. How are average global temperature even measured? Sampling using satellites, dug up ices – and we are statistically confident of the reported average global temperature. 
- **How do we communicate such facts and nuances?** 
   - Leave the players with the same feeling as a complex art would, a discomfort or an uncomfortable feeling/ Create a story, like Wall-e and Parasite. Creative and critical. 
   - Have scientists who are climate deniers as players? The player might have to make decisions that are “bad”.

   - Ensure a fact-sheet or an AI assistant
