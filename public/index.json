People to engage with climate change more openly → make people more receptive to scientific information and increase intellectual humility → address information avoidance → decrease climate fatigue and despair → climate science and advocacy more proximal to people. Do we want the players to become? Climate activists? Informed citizens? How to ensure that we don’t fall back to the “doomsday” narrative? Disengagement with the world we are currently in - distinct future/parallel universe. It is your world but fantastical element - situate our situation in another fantasy world that is similar enough but different. Make it fun, have in-jokes! How to tackle climate deniers? Example of a nobel prize physicist denying climate change. How are average global temperature even measured? Sampling using satellites, dug up ices – and we are statistically confident of the reported average global temperature. How do we communicate such facts and nuances? Leave the players with the same feeling as a complex art would, a discomfort or an uncomfortable feeling/ Create a story, like Wall-e and Parasite. Creative and critical.
