- Game World
    - Another planet - world govt
    - Climate Game Scenario: Are EVs really a “green” solution

### Game Narrative: 
- Concealed information regarding educational content of climate crisis/doomsday that gets revealed as the player plays the game. 
- Can do this through the different levels that players get through as they travel across the 3-4 regions - show climate impacts through different indirect scenarios across the game.
- Information to agree/disagree with or make decision is left in different places – letters, research articles, etc., which the player finds through the game

### Aim of our project: 
- Motivate people to take decisions and make choices 
- Give up because it's on industries
- But zero sum game where everyone needs to work 
- How do industries work and why? Our lifestyles for instance. 
- Money, put political pressure on their elective representatives. 
- Bring across gradual change - this is our goal not Problem. Action, not just awareness.
